# Siderus Lumpy - Easy and KISS desktop client for IPFS
Lumpy is an easy and KISS [inter planetary file system](http://ipfs.io) desktop
client. It allows you to easily add and remove files, and manage the repository,
the daemon and basic configuration.

![Screenshots](docs/main.png)

## Goals and Features
The user should be able to manage the repository by adding, downloading and
removing files from the node using an GUI instead of CLI or web interface.

The main goals of this project are:

* Help embracing IPFS by providing an easy to use and intuitive interface.
* Explains and **educates** the user about the perks of using IPFS
* shows only what is **important** to the user (Ex: the name of the
files/directory, not just CID)
* Help users to achieve their goals using IPFS instead of traditional tools (Download, upload, update)

### Features:

- [x] Manages the files pinned in the repository (Not just objects and CID)
- [x] Allows _Downloads_/_Uploads_ to the IPFS node
- [x] Integrates with OS actions like drag-and-drop or URI
- [x] Provides information and statistics about the repository and the daemon
- [ ] Allows to maintain a daemon from the interface
- [ ] Integration external services/tools for encryption and content distribution
